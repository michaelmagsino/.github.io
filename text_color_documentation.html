<h1>Text Color Documentation</h1>
<h2>This was by far one of the longest coding assignments I have taken on. Originally I had asked the professor for an example of a code that highlighted text at a certain time interval. It can be found here "https://github.com/aphid/aphid.github.io/blob/main/textcolor.html". In this orginal code from the professor, 
    it displays the time signature that is needed to highlight the selected text which was a great starting point to how I wanted to frame the code. The issues started up where whe I attempted to do this funtion over the same lines of code, either the function would go through each line and "emphazised" the text but 
    as soon as the next highlighted line goes, it stayed highlighted. The other issue was, which I personally don't recall doing anything wrong with my code's syntax, but when I hit run and debug, the text would highlight then disappear compeletely after it was highlighted. I think I had to to where I had the "deemphasize" 
    function remove the line of text completely (after looking at a forum on how to get the text to grow big but look smooth, as found in the p function for 'transition' found on this site "https://www.w3schools.com/css/css3_transitions.asp"). Once I dealt with all of that I was browsing Reddit and Youtube for HOURS to figure 
    out if I could do the timings as an array. I forget which reddit thread I found but it helped me visualize what I needed to do and what search parameters I needed to find a good exmaple of what I was doing. After doing the array, which displayed the text properly, I noticed that the "deemphasize" funtion was still 
    pretty wonky with my code cause it refused to work, so I instead took that function out and just used 'ele.classList.remove'. That's where I ran into the next issue which was a super simple fix. Since in the professor's orginal code example, the "emph" funtion worked under 'ele' and since I changed to an array and 
    names all the text with "line1", for exmaple, of course it wouldn't have shown. I probaly wasted an hour or two just figuring it out but that's what I get for looking up exmaple codes and taking them without reading the sytaxes. In terms of swicfthing the video, I just used a youtube to mp4 downloader and used an 
    amazing edit found on this link "https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=q_eH0HiJi18". It is by far one of my favorite gaming speeches/letter from my favorite franchises. The other main change aside from the colors were changing the allignment, from this website "https://outstandingthemes.com/how-to-center-a-video-in-html/"
    I was able to figure out how centering worked here. Aside from the various tutorials from the professor, I knew this was gonna be a difficult task because I haven't dealt with videos in html before. I ran it thorugh a program from this website "https://www.htmlvalidator.com/fix-html.php" throughout the entire process to make
    sure I was not wasting any more time. Overall there were a few things I wish I knew and understood beforehand so I can be less stressed. I also asked the professor for an exmaple on how to make the text clickable so that it goes to the right time but my brain is too fried to attmept it after an hour. </h2>
