      Started off with setting up a JSON file for my main project to hold all of the data. They are all organized into arrays, and each array contains the name of the model kit, grade, scale, price, and completion date of when they were completed or still currently being worked on. Thanks to the data poem we have done previously, I was familiar with the syntax on how to format the file.<br><br>

      The main thing I am currently researching is how to display each of the data points in the arrays within the HTML main file that will piece it all together. The professor mentioned using the fetch function to make it easier and then to create components that the fetch command will pull from.<br><br>

      At the moment, I am still experimenting with naming and how exactly the function will work when displaying it onto the main body of the HTML. I'm currently watching some YouTube tutorials to understand it better. I think I’m getting the main idea. I'm taking a break from the HTML to add more entries to my JSON file, although I don’t want to overwhelm myself with too much data that I’ll need to filter through later.<br><br>

      I’ve also added the pictures in a separate “images” folder within VS Codium. Hopefully, I’ll be able to call on those images from the JSON file. I’m a little worried it won’t function properly, but I’ll cross that bridge when I get to the coding.

      I discussed with Brandon F. how to properly style css and asked him what things should look like, be labeled, how to integrate it to my html, etc. I was a little out of my element here and have been coding the main html body on and off for the last week. Becuase I was trying to understand css, I ditched the Figma protyping entirely, it was not viable for me to use if the html is different.<br><br>
      So far I have kept it relatively simple just to get a feel for how to call on the json file correctly. It essentailly displays the kitsin the file to show the image, grade, scale, price, and completion date. It wasn't terrible to figure out, but looking through various coding examples of something like this, I added a catch error at the bottom to see if it fails to display entirely, mostly because the debug action refuses to show any images and just empty boxes, idk if there's a way to get around that but after uploading it to my repo, things are going weell so far!<br><br>
      Alongside getting the inital feel of the website, I also added more kits to the json file to see if the codding of the dynamically stacking boxeds based on your screen size works properly and so far no issues!

      After getting it all set up, it works just as I needed to, but honestly it was far too simple as a final project, so after looking at a few different sites for inspiration, I decided to add a sortin gfuntionality along with a search by function. And then after trying to copy a line-graph example and adapting it to my json file, endedd up with a very incomplete "Cost Chart"<br><br>
      I started off with having to define the specific grades and their scale using the < option value = "*Grade*"></ option >, a sort function, and after a bit of messing around with, an auto complete search query showing name, and small image on a pull down tab. I also added a function of <br><br>
      As far as that layout went, it felt much better than the plain cards of gundam kits and a boring title. So with the additon of having a header tab that includes the filtering options, it is a bit more robust with the data search through, and startin gfrom scartch and a loit of YouTube and Reddit walk-throughs, is something I can be pretty happy with.<br><br>
      As you can probably tell from the number of my commits, becuase of the limited debug in VSCodium, I had to go through small but important revisons to implenting the data from json to be translated to the line graph I wanted. It remains on the current page now as I try to get through it, been very frustrating on that department.

      There was not too much that I added for the final revision of my final project, I just had to catalogue most (if not all) of the model kits I have built within the last few years. Currently uploading it alongside the documentation that I haven't updated since I started.<br><br>
      I am curious to see how large and how they are laid out on the main page. Since this will probably be my final documentation, this entire process of styling and creating my perosnl gundam page was a lot of long hours on my computer blasting a random show in the backlground as I lay out the code that I needed. It felt like a fever dream for most of it becuase I inevitably coded super late (around 1am to 4am).<br><br>
      I have learned a lot, and failed even more times than I can even remember. We hsall see where this goes, maybe over the summer I will figure out how to do the gundam cost graph properly. Until next time, thank you for checking in.
