    <h3>Started off with setting up a json file for my main project to hold in all of the data. They are all organized into arrays, and each array contains the name of the model kit, grade, scale, price and completion date of when they were completed/am still currently working on. Thanks to the data poem we have done previously, I was familiar with the syntax on how to format the file. The main thing I am currently researching is how to display each of the data points in the arrays within the html main file that will piece it all together. The professor mentioned using the fetch function to make it a little easier and then to create components that the fetch command will pull from. As of this monet I am still messing around with naming and how exactly that function will work when displaying it onto the main body of the html. I am currently going through some Youtube videos on how to properly understand it better. I think I am getting the main idea, I am currently taking a break from working on the html to add more to my json file. Although I do not want to have to worry about inputting too much data for me to have to use and filter through. I currently have also added the pictures in a separate “images” folder within VS Codium, hopefully I will be able to call on that image using the json file. I worry that it will not function properly but I’ll ask that when I get to coding.</h3>
