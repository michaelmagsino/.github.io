      Started off with setting up a JSON file for my main project to hold all of the data. They are all organized into arrays, and each array contains the name of the model kit, grade, scale, price, and completion date of when they were completed or still currently being worked on. Thanks to the data poem we have done previously, I was familiar with the syntax on how to format the file.<br><br>

      The main thing I am currently researching is how to display each of the data points in the arrays within the HTML main file that will piece it all together. The professor mentioned using the fetch function to make it easier and then to create components that the fetch command will pull from.<br><br>

      At the moment, I am still experimenting with naming and how exactly the function will work when displaying it onto the main body of the HTML. I'm currently watching some YouTube tutorials to understand it better. I think I’m getting the main idea. I'm taking a break from the HTML to add more entries to my JSON file, although I don’t want to overwhelm myself with too much data that I’ll need to filter through later.<br><br>

      I’ve also added the pictures in a separate “images” folder within VS Codium. Hopefully, I’ll be able to call on those images from the JSON file. I’m a little worried it won’t function properly, but I’ll cross that bridge when I get to the coding.
