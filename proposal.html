<h1>Figma Prototype Proposal</h1>
<h3>I plan on doing UX/UI design for my future career, so it would make the most sense to me to implement coding to my project. I was thinking of a web-based application so anyone can use it/test it out! Figma is primarily a front-end development tool to create UI elements, but once I get the main layout I want I will then code the back-end with either javascript or html & css (maybe html because that is what I have been coding with throughout this quarter).</h3>
<h3>The main project I would like to propose is a type of inventory management of my hobby in Gundam model kit building. My plan for this is creating and compiling a list of the Gundams I have built, the costs of each kit, the costs of extra supplies, future kits I want to purchase, direct links to each kit I wanna buy, and if I have time, some sort of calendar element/alert of the release schedules of new Gundams that are up for preorder and also am option to manually add in kits I recently got with some sort of interface to take in information of the kits.</h3>

<h2>Steps</h2>
<h3>1 - Set up the Prototype on Figma, this step can be relatively quick because all I intend to do is to get a general layout that I will reference as I code.</h3>
<h3>2 - After initial prototyping, I will start coding the skeleton of the layout, i.e., the framing of where elements will go.</h3>
<h3>3 -  Once I am happy with the layout, I will then add in the images, links, costs, etc. I am assuming this is where I will take the longest because of the sizing of images/text sizing (I may do a carousel of various images for each kit)</h3>
<h3>4 - If I have time to, I will then focus on the styling of the web app/site to make it look aesthetically pleasing but again, I shall see depending on how step 3 goes.</h3>

<h2>Tools and Methodologies</h2>
<h3>Figma - this is where I will set up my layout and also reference the coding schemes behind it using various plug-ins (I do not know which ones yet, but there are plenty to choose from!)</h3>
<h3>YouTube - I have always used YouTube for quick learning and understanding how coding works within a system</h3>
<h3>Reddit - this is where I go if there is a specific niche that isn’t widely explained on YouTube, and many creators share their own code to reference</h3>
<h3>Other Forums - if Reddit does not have anything, then random forums I shall go! I will just use Google to link me to appropriate forums (although most of the time they don't really have what I need/want)</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Documentation of Project</h2>
<h3>I will do the documentation on a separate Google Docs file with dates  just for ease of reference, but I will then copy/paste it on the Git commit line with each new version (once I start coding, for the Figma Prototyping, I will use screenshots of my work and also the Figma file itself!).</h3>

<hr>

<h2>Concept</h2>
<h3>I have slowly been becoming more of an organized person throughout the last two years, so I might as well implement that  going forward within this project. It will not only keep track of what I have built, but also track the costs of each kit (so it forces me to not buy anymore within my spending limit). It’s also something I would want to share with the Gundam building community in the future once I get it polished!</h3>
