    <h2>
      I was not familiar with any of these tools, but the one that interested me the most (and to be honest, the most simple) was using D3 to visualize data. To my chagrin, it looked easier than it actually was. I wanted to represent the data of games I’ve played and their corresponding hours in a pie chart. I started in Excel and created a chart by inputting games with decent playtime, then exported it as a .csv file.<br><br>

      My main issue at first was figuring out why the pie chart wasn’t displaying on the main page. It turned out the problem was with the labels in the .csv file — I used “game” and “hours” as headers, but the code expected “name” and “value.” Instead of rewriting the code, I renamed the headers in the .csv to save time.<br><br>

      The next issue came after the chart finally loaded: the game titles were too long and overlapped on the pie chart. I tried increasing the arc radius and changing font sizes from 500 to 800 — but that only made things worse. Even after multiple attempts and commits on GitHub, I ended up reverting to an earlier working version. Lesson learned: **don’t forget about old commits.**<br><br>

      For now, the chart still has overlapping labels. I’ll revisit this once I figure out a clean way to handle long names in limited space.
