            <h3>This was my final project for CT20 and it is basically an audio visuallizer. Intially going into my old project, I wanted to add more depth as it looked and functioned pretty plainly for the most part. I had intially began working on iterating my old project this past week (4/13/25) but unfortunately the autosave function from p5.js failed me and I only had my orginal copy instead of the new iteration file. So I had very limited time to add to my old project and that, in hindsight, is something I need to check over from now on. What I was able to implement into my new design was instead of having the central line (that is also a wave form) move along with the arcs, I had it coded so that it moved only when the songs were playing and went back to the center when it stopped. In my quick re-code of it this afternoon (4/16/25), I was unable to code it properly (line 371-396). The only thing I was able to successfully do was chaneg the background image to a galaxy whenever the amplitude went over 230. It is well shown when you play the song under "X-Mood". I attempted to add a slider for the volume but it would not set the volume correctly so i gave them a set volume so it isnt too loud. When using this, be aware that pressing the same key multiple times (besides "p") will play the song again on top of the already playing song. Just hit "p" to stop everything!  </h3>
